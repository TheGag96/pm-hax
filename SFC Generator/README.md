# SFC Generator
Written by codes. This is a GUI tool to create Song Forcer Codes based on my own version of wiiztec's original code that chooses song IDs randomly in a setlist for the configured stage/combo. 

The program was written in [D](http://dlang.org) with the GUI library [dlangui](https://github.com/buggins/dlangui).
